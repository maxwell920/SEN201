## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

### Stage 1: Requirement Identification  
The aim of this project was to design and implement a simple task management system for students. The system was required to:
- Allow users to add tasks.
- Display a list of all tasks.
- Enable users to mark tasks as completed.
- Run on a command-line interface using Python.

---

### Stage 2: Application Structure Planning  
The system was planned as a modular Python application. Functions were designed to handle different operations such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, and completing tasks. A list data structure was selected to store task information and track completion status.

---

### Stage 3: Program Development  
The application was implemented using Python. Functions were written for each core feature, and control structures were used to navigate through a menu-driven interface. Dictionaries were used to represent individual tasks with attributes for task name and completion status.

---

### Stage 4: Verification and Validation  
The system was tested by:
- Adding multiple tasks to confirm proper storage.
- Viewing tasks to ensure correct display and status updates.
- Marking tasks as completed to verify state changes.
- Entering invalid input to check the system’s stability.

---

### Stage 5: Release and Submission  
The completed project was uploaded to a public GitHub repository. The repository contains the source code and documentation, making the system accessible for review, execution, and academic assessment.
